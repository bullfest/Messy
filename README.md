# Messy
A simple messaging app

## Installation
If you have [Poetry](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/) installed then simply run
```
poetry install
```
Otherwise, I've supplied the requirements.txt that's output from Poetry install those requirements by running
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
